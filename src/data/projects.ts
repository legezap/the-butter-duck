Edge-lit acrylic panels turned individual products into illuminated display pieces. The entire structure sat on a raised platform with concealed uplighting, giving it a floating appearance that stopped foot traffic. All cabling ran through hollow aluminium extrusions — not a single wire visible anywhere.",
