Each product needed to be experienced in its intended context — accent lighting in a living room vignette, task lighting in a kitchen scene, decorative pendants in a hospitality setting — while allowing visitors to control dimming, colour temperature, and beam angles in real time.",
    solution:
      "We divided the stand into four themed zones, each built as a partial room set with realistic finishes — oak-effect flooring, plaster-texture walls, marble-look countertops. A custom DALI lighting control system linked all products to four iPad stations, letting visitors adjust any fixture in the zone with a tap. Track-mounted power rails above each zone allowed products to be hot-swapped between show days without any re-wiring.",

    solution:
      "We designed a museum-style product display system using individual illuminated plinths with tempered glass covers, each housing a single hero product with technical spec cards printed on brushed aluminium panels. The stand's material language — brushed stainless steel trims, anthracite-tinted glass partitions, and charcoal stone-effect flooring — reinforced the industrial premium positioning. A secure back-of-house area with lockable roller shutters stored reserve inventory, while a fully enclosed meeting room with acoustic glazing provided privacy for procurement negotiations.",
