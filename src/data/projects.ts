    overview:
      "A 25 sqm compact stand for Altronix at Intersec, Dubai's leading security, safety, and fire protection trade fair. The design centered on dramatic blue LED integration that turned a small footprint into one of the most visually striking presences on the show floor, reflecting Altronix's position in power and surveillance infrastructure. This was one of six stands we've built for Altronix across multiple editions of Intersec.",
    challenge:
      "Making a 25 sqm island stand compete visually against neighbours with triple the floor space and budget. The client's product range — power supplies and surge protection for CCTV systems — is technically dense but visually undramatic, requiring a design language that communicated innovation and reliability without relying on the products themselves as visual anchors.",
    solution:
      "We wrapped the stand in a continuous LED light channel running at fascia height, programmable in colour and intensity to create a glowing beacon effect visible from 30+ metres. Product displays were backlit in matching blue tones using edge-lit acrylic panels. The entire structure was built on a raised platform with concealed perimeter lighting, giving the stand a floating appearance. All wiring ran through hollow aluminium extrusions, keeping the surfaces completely clean.",
