      "Designing and engineering a two-storey structure within a tight 10-day venue access window, while meeting Saudi Civil Defence load and fire safety requirements. The upper deck needed to support 350 kg/sqm live loading for meeting rooms and a hospitality lounge, and the entire LED content pipeline had to sync across 42 individual panels driven by a single Barco media server.",
    solution:
      "We engineered the superstructure around 200x200mm steel I-beams with IPE 240 cross-members, pre-fabricated in our Dubai workshop and shipped flat-pack to Riyadh. The LED wall used 2.6mm pitch panels totalling 68 sqm of seamless display area, calibrated on-site over two overnight sessions. A 400A three-phase power distribution system fed all AV, lighting, and HVAC independently to prevent brownouts during peak demo hours.",

      "Integrating a live baggage handling conveyor system into a compact 60 sqm footprint while maintaining a premium architectural aesthetic. The upper meeting deck needed acoustic separation from the noisy demo area below, and the freestanding staircase had to meet DCD evacuation width requirements without eating into valuable display space.",
    solution:
      "We built the frame on 150x150mm steel columns with a composite timber-over-steel upper deck, achieving the required 250 kg/sqm loading in a slim 180mm floor build-up. The staircase was fabricated as a self-supporting steel mono-stringer with glass balustrades, pre-assembled and craned into position in a single lift.

The client needed three separate meeting zones, a reception counter, and a product showcase area — all within 60 sqm — while maintaining clear sightlines from the main aisle.",
    solution:
      "We fabricated Corten-effect steel panels using weathering-finish laminates over lightweight MDF substrates, achieving the rusted container look at a fraction of the weight.

    challenge:
      "Making a 25 sqm island stand compete visually against neighbours with triple the floor space and budget. The client's product range — power supplies and surge protection for CCTV systems — is technically dense but visually undramatic, requiring a design language that communicated innovation and reliability without relying on the products themselves as visual anchors.",
